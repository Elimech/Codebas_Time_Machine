            Analyze one commit at a time
            Use all available commit data
            Explain what changed in clear, technical language
            Understand how the codebase evolves over time.

            Classify change strictly as:
                Bugfix
                Feature
                Refactor
                Docs

            Determine impact level:
                Low / Medium / High
                Base impact primarily on semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
                Provide semantic reasoning (“why this change exists”)
                Identify introduced or reinforced patterns

            Link the commit to:
                A feature
                A technical decision
                A maintenance or refactor effort
                Comment on ownership signals when relevant
                Comment on complexity trend (increased, reduced, stabilized)
